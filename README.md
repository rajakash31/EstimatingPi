# EstimatingPi

Pi is an irrational number, and it's not possible to obtain the exact value of pi. However, there are various methods to estimate the value of Pi. One of the method is using Monte Carlo Simulation method.

If a circle is inscribe in a square, with a radius of circle as r, then:
Area of Cirle = pi * r^2
Area of Square = 4 * r^2

So, pi = 4 * (Area of Circle)/(Area of Square)

Instead of using area of circle and square, we can count the number of pins that falls in the circle or square when randomly dropped. Monte Carlo Simulation with 10k simulation was used to estimate the value of Pi.
